## Mac:

The security settings on your Mac are likely configured so that you get a warning when you try and open an app that you downloaded from the internet.  Tripoli is not malware, and we are not secretly downloading your unpublished data -- we have enough of our own!  To open Tripoli anyway, open System Settings (the gear icon on your dock), then click on "Privacy and Security" in the left-hand menu. Scroll down on the right-hand side of the window until you see a prompt asking if you want to "Open Anyway".

Click the "Open Anyway" button, enter your password if needed, and the Tripoli application will open.  

You only need to go to Privacy and Security settings once to open this .jar file.  Double-clicking on it in the future will just open Tripoli.  However, when you download a new version of Tripoli with a new version number and filename, you'll need to repeat the process.  Or, you can open Tripoli from the command line using the instructions in the [Starting Tripoli](../using_Tripoli/05-StartingTripoli.md "Starting Tripoli") section.
