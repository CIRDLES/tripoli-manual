# Before you start

Before you start Tripoli, make sure that you have:
- [x] Downloaded and installed the correct Java application,
- [x] Downloaded the latest Tripoli .jar file from the GitHub repository, and
- [x] Moved the Tripoli.jar file to a dedicated folder on your hard drive, for instance a folder named "Tripoli" inside your "Documents" folder.

# The easy way: double-click a .jar file 

In most cases, the simplest way to start the Tripoli application is to double-click on the .jar file you downloaded from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli "GitHub Repository").  The .jar file contains everything you need to open the application and start reviewing data.  This approach is likely the best when setting up Tripoli on a shared lab computer, where users with a variety of software comfort levels will be opening Tripoli.  If you just double-clicked the Tripoli .jar file and nothing happened, or you got a warning, see OS-specific troubleshooting below.
