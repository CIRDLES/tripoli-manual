Once you've successfully [installed Java](./01-Installation.md), you're ready to download Tripoli from GitHub.

# Go to the Tripoli repository's software releases at GitHub

Go [here](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli/releases "Tripoli Releases") to find the latest Triopli release.  
We will always release new versions here, along with some release notes that describe what's new in this version.  You can scroll down to access all past versions of Redux.  Version numbers will get the "-alpha" tag as long as Triopli is in its initial development stages.  Please use Tripoli, find bugs, and make suggestions!  We will document how to use Tripoli and how we've tested it here.

# Find the Tripoli .jar file

In the release you want to download (generally the most recent one at the top), click the word "Assets" to show the downloadable files for that release.

# Download Tripoli's .jar file

Click on the blue link text for the top option in Assets, called "Tripoli-X.Y.Z.jar" where X.Y.Z is the version number.  This will download the Java ARchive (.jar) file to your browser or OS downloads folder.  This file contains all you need to run Tripoli on your computer.

# Move the Tripoli .jar file to a permanent location

Move the Tripoli .jar file to a folder you've created on your hard drive for Tripoli.  Other files that Tripoli creates as part of its data reduction will appear in this folder as well, so leaving it in your very large Downloads folder is not a good idea.

Congratulations, you've downloaded Tripoli! You're ready to fire it up and load in some data!
